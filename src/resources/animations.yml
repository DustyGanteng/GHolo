# ===============================================================================================
#
# Animations are created from an id
# An animation contains a tick amount that defines how quickly the animation is updated in ticks
# The content of the animation defines which lines should be looped through
#
# PlaceholderAPI placeholders can be used in an animation, if active
#
# Animations can contain other animations, but only those created before the containing animation
# In the default example with "test" and "test_2" -> only "test2" may contain "test" but "test" may not contain "test_2"
#
# You can insert an animation in the format "%animation_id%" like "%test%"
#
